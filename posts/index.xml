      <description>Things I did today  bought some ingredients so the girl can make a cake went to B&amp;amp;Q to buy some nice new wood drillbits. They&amp;rsquo;re the auger type. I like. finished the compost heap container conversion from the boy&amp;rsquo;s old bed frame. This took all morning. lunch at JDW with a pint of Wimbledon Quartermaine. (Not too fond of this pint; it is 5.8% but the strength is in the depth of sweet crystally flavours.</description>

      <description>Things I did today  build SuperCollider v3 from source, because there&amp;rsquo;s no APK of it for my old Ubuntu 14.04 set -up got going with some intro tutorials for Tidal Cycles, in preparation for going along to a Tidal meet-up at London Music Hackspace tomorrow night more explorations with my Befaco modular:  tried setting up the Rampage module as a slew limiter (i.e. to apply pitch portamento) - easy enough!</description>

      <description>Back to Paul-40%-form, got a shitton of stuff done today.
 went for a run fitted some new mains power sockets in the kitchen with integral USB ports cleaned the bloomin&#39; fish tank again. (Fishies looked happier although) adapted / fixed an arrangement of Bjork&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Anchor Song&amp;rdquo; that I found on Musescore. It had problems in the middle of the piece where voice around saxophones play together. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping I&amp;rsquo;ll do this in The Crooks, but unless a sax covers it, someone&amp;rsquo;s going to have to sing!</description>

      <description>Photos from the area around Bakewell / Chatsworth to follow. Lovely weather and a striking landscape. Some nice country pubs too!
Back to London in a tedious but essentially clear run down the M1.
Saxophone quartet practice in the evening. First outing for my arrangement of Suite del Angel by Astor Piazolla, which I&amp;rsquo;ve been obsessing over for several months now.</description>

      <description>Nice day trip up to Bletchley with Martin and David. There we met up with the Google Security &amp;amp; Privacy team based in Zurich (about a hundred of them!) and enjoyed touring the National Museum of Computing on the edge of the Bletchley estate, followed by the huts and historic house in Bletchley Park itself.
Lots of photos to follow. A very interesting day out.
Returned on the slow train to London.</description>

      <title>Bank Holiday Monday during half-term</title>

      <description>School half term We were in Norfolk. Went for a nice walk with rachel in the sunshine along the banks of the river Nar, through meadows and woods to the ford in the road leading into West Acre. Then we came home again, because the pub there (The Stag) was shut. What pub landlord would never open on a Bank Holiday Monday?!</description>

      <title>Crafting a new synth patch</title>

      <description>Things I did with my 40% time today  watched a tutorialby Quincas (&#39;SynthDIYGuy&#39; on Youtube) showing how to craft a classic Moog-esque patch on the Erica Synths DIY kits tried to reproduce this on my Befaco rig. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get the same sound, as I&amp;rsquo;m not quite finding how to modulate the filter in the same way. But what I did get seems interesting!   made beer bread using a Barretsridge mixmy sister gave me at Christmas.</description>

      <description>Things I did with my 40% time today  Crafted a pretty silly patch on the Befaco Rig. It&amp;rsquo;s dominated by filter resonance and feedback through the reverb unit, with movement contributed by the Rampage ramp generator. The actual notes driving it can&amp;rsquo;t be heard at all! I uploaded it to Soundcloud &amp;hellip; keep the volume down though, the feedback gets a bit out of control at times&amp;hellip;   Started learning how to use Tidal Cycles.</description>

      <description>Unexpected 40% time today Miranda is sick with sore throat, etc., so I unexpectedly have another day at home. Next week will be a 4-day working week to make up for this day off.
Things I did with my 40% time today   realised I&amp;rsquo;ll soon forget all the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing, so got to work recording it in this blog. I&amp;rsquo;m going to need to brush up on ReactJS to make it look any different to the default how to build a blog using Gatsby tutorials</description>

      <description>Things I did with my 40% time today  fixed the Befaco VC ADSR  the embarrassing cause of it&amp;rsquo;s not-workingness was that (again) I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten to solder some of the front panel connectors :-/ now the trigger button correctly launches the full Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release cycle    had the realisation that a VCO and this ADSR is not enough to shape sound - the ADSR is generating an envelope control signal that something else must apply to the audio path.</description>

      <description>Things I did with my 40% time today  went for a 6km run with Rachel finished building my Befaco MIDI thing module for the mid-life-crisis project  this one wasn&amp;rsquo;t very hard and seemed to work first time. getting my head round setting the modes is a different matter though!    built the Befaco VC ADSR which I reckon I&amp;rsquo;ll be getting a lot of use from  tested it, and just can&amp;rsquo;t make it work!</description>

      <description>Things I did with my 40% time today  30 mins yoga routine using an Android app I just discovered; followed by some headspace finished building the Befaco Even VCO  walked 3.5miles to Croydon city centre and back, in quite warm sunny weather visited Jonathan Myall&amp;rsquo;s music shop. This is a lovely olde-world fronted shop with a focus on woodwind, but a good music selection for all instruments upstairs.  bought the piano accompaniment book to Miranda&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Fiddle Time Runners&amp;rdquo; violin book bought myself a Legere tenor sax reed (strength 2.</description>

      <description>Things I did with my 40% time today   This was the last day of our Easter break, and Oscar was still on holiday due to an Inset day at school (Miranda was back at school, which left her feeling miffed)
  Top-notch burger lunch outdoors in the Crystal Palace triangle at Roti Brothers. I had the spiciest one, it was amazing, just like everyone has said.   Started work building the VCO (Voltage-Controlled Oscillator) module for my mid-life crisis project ^W^W^Wnew synth.</description>
