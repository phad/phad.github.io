 Subodh Iyengar (Facebook) / PrivateStats: Anonymous Authenticated Logging at Scale / homepage video slides
FB use a lot of client-side telemetry from their apps. They want to log data without associating it to the user. This is private logging.
If it&amp;rsquo;s aggregate data, then there&amp;rsquo;s no need to identify users. But if it isn&amp;rsquo;t, there are problems; how can they trust the log data with no user ID?</description>

 Kenny Patterson (ETH Zurich) / SWiSSSE: System-Wide Security for Searchable Symmetric Encryption / paper video slides
There&amp;rsquo;s a github repo
Searchable Encryption: how do you permit keyword searching over a corpus of encrypted documents?
Symmetric: they&amp;rsquo;re only allowing use of symmetric techniques, for efficiency.
Server might have a search index, a keyvalue store, where PRF(search keyword)-&amp;gt;Enc(matching doc ids). All value entries have same size to avoid attacks like freq analysis, so all doc id lists are padded to max size.</description>

      <description>Things I did with my 40% time today  watched a tutorialby Quincas (&#39;SynthDIYGuy&#39; on Youtube) showing how to craft a classic Moog-esque patch on the Erica Synths DIY kits tried to reproduce this on my Befaco rig. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get the same sound, as I&amp;rsquo;m not quite finding how to modulate the filter in the same way. But what I did get seems interesting!   made beer bread using a Barretsridge mixmy sister gave me at Christmas.</description>

      <description>Things I did with my 40% time today  Crafted a pretty silly patch on the Befaco Rig. It&amp;rsquo;s dominated by filter resonance and feedback through the reverb unit, with movement contributed by the Rampage ramp generator. The actual notes driving it can&amp;rsquo;t be heard at all! I uploaded it to Soundcloud &amp;hellip; keep the volume down though, the feedback gets a bit out of control at times&amp;hellip;   Started learning how to use Tidal Cycles.</description>

      <description>Unexpected 40% time today Miranda is sick with sore throat, etc., so I unexpectedly have another day at home. Next week will be a 4-day working week to make up for this day off.
Things I did with my 40% time today   realised I&amp;rsquo;ll soon forget all the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing, so got to work recording it in this blog. I&amp;rsquo;m going to need to brush up on ReactJS to make it look any different to the default how to build a blog using Gatsby tutorials</description>

      <description>Things I did with my 40% time today  fixed the Befaco VC ADSR  the embarrassing cause of it&amp;rsquo;s not-workingness was that (again) I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten to solder some of the front panel connectors :-/ now the trigger button correctly launches the full Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release cycle    had the realisation that a VCO and this ADSR is not enough to shape sound - the ADSR is generating an envelope control signal that something else must apply to the audio path.</description>

      <description>Things I did with my 40% time today  went for a 6km run with Rachel finished building my Befaco MIDI thing module for the mid-life-crisis project  this one wasn&amp;rsquo;t very hard and seemed to work first time. getting my head round setting the modes is a different matter though!    built the Befaco VC ADSR which I reckon I&amp;rsquo;ll be getting a lot of use from  tested it, and just can&amp;rsquo;t make it work!</description>

      <description>Things I did with my 40% time today  30 mins yoga routine using an Android app I just discovered; followed by some headspace finished building the Befaco Even VCO  walked 3.5miles to Croydon city centre and back, in quite warm sunny weather visited Jonathan Myall&amp;rsquo;s music shop. This is a lovely olde-world fronted shop with a focus on woodwind, but a good music selection for all instruments upstairs.  bought the piano accompaniment book to Miranda&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Fiddle Time Runners&amp;rdquo; violin book bought myself a Legere tenor sax reed (strength 2.</description>

      <description>Things I did with my 40% time today   This was the last day of our Easter break, and Oscar was still on holiday due to an Inset day at school (Miranda was back at school, which left her feeling miffed)
  Top-notch burger lunch outdoors in the Crystal Palace triangle at Roti Brothers. I had the spiciest one, it was amazing, just like everyone has said.   Started work building the VCO (Voltage-Controlled Oscillator) module for my mid-life crisis project ^W^W^Wnew synth.</description>
